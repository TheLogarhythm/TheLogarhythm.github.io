## About Me

Hi! I am Luoyi Zhang, an undergraduate student double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), currently on an exchange program at Georgia Tech to broaden my academic horizons. Driven by a passion for the interdisciplinary depths of computing, I'm particularly fascinated by the intersection of mathematical theory and practical software development. I'm eager to participate in research projects and contribute to advancing this visually compelling field, while continuing to build innovative solutions through hands-on projects like the one showcased here.

## Project Overview

GT Movies Store is a full-featured e-commerce web application built with Django that allows users to browse, search, and purchase movies online. The platform was developed as part of CS2340 (Introduction to Web Development) at Georgia Tech.

**Technical Stack**: Django, Python, SQLite, Bootstrap 5, HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## Key Features Implemented

### User Authentication System
- Secure user registration and login functionality
- Session management and user-specific content
- Protected routes for authenticated users only

### Movie Catalog & Search
- Responsive movie browsing interface
- Advanced search with real-time filtering
- Detailed movie pages with descriptions and pricing

### Review System
- User-generated reviews and ratings
- Edit/delete functionality for user's own reviews
- Average rating calculation and display

### Shopping Cart & Checkout
- Session-based shopping cart
- Add/remove items with quantity adjustment
- Order processing with confirmation system

### Administrative Features
- Django admin interface for content management
- Order tracking and user management
- Inventory control capabilities

## Implementation Process

### Development Methodology
I followed an iterative development approach with four distinct phases:

1. **Foundation & Setup** - Project initialization, environment setup, and version control
2. **Data Modeling** - Database schema design with Django models
3. **Core Functionality** - Implementing user stories one by one
4. **Polish & Testing** - UI refinement, responsiveness, and comprehensive testing

### Problem-Solving Approach
When encountering challenges, I employed:
- Stack Overflow and Django documentation for technical issues
- Peer programming sessions for complex functionality
- Systematic debugging using Django's built-in development server
- User story validation to ensure requirements were met

## Technical Challenges Overcome

1. **Session Management** - Implementing persistent shopping cart functionality
2. **User Authentication** - Customizing Django's built-in auth system
3. **Database Relations** - Establishing proper relationships between models
4. **Responsive Design** - Ensuring compatibility across device sizes

## Future Enhancements

- Payment gateway integration (Stripe/PayPal)
- Movie recommendation engine
- Social features (watchlists, friends, sharing)
- Advanced filtering and sorting options
- Mobile app version using React Native

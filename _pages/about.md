Education
======
**The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)**  
- *BSc in Computer Science & Mathematics, 2023 - May 2027 (Expected)*  
- Cumulative Grade Average (CGA): **4.154/4.3**

**Georgia Institute of Technology**  
- *Exchange Semester, Fall 2025*

Research Experience
======
**4D Gaussian Splatting with Tiling and Loopable Animation**  
*Undergraduate Researcher, supervised by Prof. Pedro V. Sander*  
*HKUST, 2025 - Present*

Working on advanced techniques in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) with focus on creating seamless spatial tiling and temporally coherent loopable animations. This research explores extending 3D Gaussian Splatting to the temporal domain while maintaining spatial and temporal coherence for applications in procedural content generation and real-time rendering.

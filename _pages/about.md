Hello! I am an undergraduate student double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Driven by a passion for the interdisciplinary depths of computing, I am currently on an exchange program at Georgia Tech to broaden my academic horizons. My specific interest lies in computer graphics, where I aim to apply my strong analytical background to its core challenges. I am eager to participate in research projects and contribute to advancing this visually compelling field.

## Project Overview

This ongoing research project explores advanced techniques in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) with specific focus on:
- **Tiling**: Developing methods for seamless spatial tiling of 4D Gaussian representations
- **Loopable Animation**: Creating temporally coherent animations that loop seamlessly

## Research Focus

The project investigates how to extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to the temporal domain while maintaining spatial coherence for tiling applications and temporal coherence for animation loops. This work has potential applications in procedural content generation, real-time rendering, and interactive graphics.

## Supervision

This project is conducted under the supervision of **Prof. Pedro V. Sander** at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

## Status

**Work in Progress** - Expected completion and submission in 2026.
